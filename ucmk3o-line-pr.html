                            <p> This is the best tl;dr I could make, original (https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3006638/how-chinas-canadian-lobbyists-blurred-lines-pr-journalism-and) reduced by 93%. (I'm a bot) > Solstice Public Affairs senior associate Karen Lin Woods with Ontario provincial parliamentarian Sheref Sabawy, and Senator Victor Oh, at a Chinese consular event celebrating Chinese National Day on October 1 in Toronto. > Solstice hired Woods partly on the strength of her Chinese communit. At my team we do have linters in place that auto lint and auto check and fix during commits and builds. One of my coworkers/junior has their own special linter that they use and push in every pr and overwrite other people's work or rewrites things like will rewrite flavours of loops , will change from for to while or add empty lines or convert static data. The coworker is not an architect or lead and approves every pr blindly and I believe is overcompensating at work. They sneak in changes. 
In my opinion, there’s no denying that whomever wrote this letter, was an avid movie watcher. Everything I’ve read over the years points to the fact that the Ramsey’s were not big on movies. They had none of the films listed below in their home and supposedly hadn’t been to a movie theater in a long time. With that said, the similarities of the below movie quotes (and plots) to the ransom note cannot simply be ignored. Dirty Harry “Now listen to me carefully. Listen very carefully.” >In line with the result of the Parliamentary Voting System referendum in 2011, the Government will not change the current First Past the Post voting system for elections to the House of Commons. Link to petition: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/245488 This was posted here a couple of weeks ago, and I would like to say that this chap (https://reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/b7wybl/petition_to_change_the_voting_system_to_one_of/ejuzhg6/) called. https://youtu.be/754ufBmD1ds (https://youtu.be/754ufBmD1ds) Just uploaded this one. Hope you enjoy! All the relevant info is in the description (patch download link- you will have to purchase/download the Ownhammer IRs yourself, though). If anyone would be interested in some other patches, let me know. I'm wanting to expand my YouTube channel to incorporate videos where I talk about tone crafting, gear, etc- if there's interest. I'm pretty sure Helix Native has a trial version. Mine is “I built a constellation lair, out of the moles that hovered there” Hi, I'm a newbie. I've noticed that changing the TPL value in the project properties also affects the playback speed, so I can't figure out how to properly set the value of bpm. I feel that I'm missing something in how ticks work. I've understood that they are the smallest unit of time in the pattern, so that, for example one can use some particular effect that need changes in a time smaller that a line. So this seems to mean that the line duration (in time) isn't fixed Hello guys, I'm a Communication undergrad student who's set to graduate in May. I'm currently looking for ACTUALLY good companies to work for--preferably a company that has a healthy environment and that pays right for what they want their employees to do for them. I can do well at the following fields: writing (i.e. features, news, literary, and scriptwriting), photography and photo-editing, and acting. I don't plan to work for TV stations especially ABS-CBN because I heard that the politics. No need to protect Roman. 
So, perhaps I'm remembering this wrong, but wasn't there a plotline in Persepolis Rising between Duarte and Cortazar regarding the transformation of Duarte? I thought that Duarte forced Cortazar to apply the same immortality/brain improvement treatment/transformation to himself as an insurance that Cortazar doesn't fail since it would also mean his own demise? So in that case, Cortazar should have the same state after the unconsciousness attack as Duarte. He should. A bit of context, my aunt does business with a guitar retailer and can occasionally pick something from their returned stock. She wants to get me a college graduation present which is great, but she knows absolutely nothing about guitar brands/models. The only other time she's done this I asked if she could get a Taylor acoustic, and she came back with a friggin gorgeous gs7, (https://www.chicagomusicexchange.com/listing/taylor-gs7-natural-2007-s130/9970930) so basically I have the opportunity. </p>
